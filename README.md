# FizzBuzz 

By [Tony Chung](http://www.github.com/tonycchung).

**Basic**  
FizzBuzz.rb prints out a list of numbers from 1 to input x unless the number is divisible by  
3, 5, or both in which case Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz will be printed, respectively.  

**Advanced**  
FizzBuzzAdvanced.rb takes in two arguments, a hash and an integer. The hash should  
contain words as its keys and integers as its values to add any arbitray number/string sets  
that can be printed out.
